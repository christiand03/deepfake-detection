        ``rank`` is keyword-only, and must stay that way. It previously sat between ``msg`` and
        ``*args``, so the standard lazy-formatting call ``log.info("loaded %s", path)`` bound
        ``path`` to ``rank`` and left ``*args`` empty. That had two silent effects: placeholders
        rendered literally (or raised ``TypeError: %d format: a real number is required``), and
        because line ~48 then compares a garbage ``rank`` against the current rank, the message
        was dropped entirely whenever they differed. 64 call sites in this project pass
        format arguments this way.
